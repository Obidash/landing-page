                        <p>This was completely electric go kart I made for my highschool shop class. It involed machining and welding an aluminum frame and making a makeshift transmission system.</p>

                        <p>An assitive hand exo-skeleton that was made from my second year capstone project. My team and I developed a app controlled linkage arm brace based attachment that provided users increased grip strength</p>

                        <h5>Precision Mars Rover Claw</h5>
                        <p>This Project was a task i set out to do to help my design team, we make a mars rover that needs to do various tasks. I made a presicion system for the claw that would allow the rover to do tasks like plug in a usb.</p>
